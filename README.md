# RDF Documents Language in Haskell

Hey! This repository is all about creating a domain-specific query language (DSQL) for RDF documents using Haskell. If you're into semantic web technologies and functional programming, you'll find this project fascinating.

## Features

- **Domain-Specific Language**: Tailored for querying RDF documents.
- **Haskell Implementation**: Leveraging Haskell's strong type system and functional paradigms.
- **Grammar Definitions**: Custom grammar for parsing RDF queries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
- Alex and Happy (Lexer and Parser generators for Haskell)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Robert-Stoica/RDF-Documents-Language-Haskell.git
